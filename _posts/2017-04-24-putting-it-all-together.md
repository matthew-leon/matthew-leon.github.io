Now that the enclosure is cut, it's time to put it all together! I've assembled the box, attached the components, hooked up the breadboard, and have (temporarily) sealed the tube. I still need to work out some of the scaling issues in the patch, but it's working! Check out some photos and videos of me testing it below. 

Some photos of the boxes:
