**Beeping Bela**

For my first project using the [Bela](http://bela.io), I 3D-printed an enclosure to fully contain the bela, and all its wiring and inputs. In order to create this case, I found an [existing box for the Beaglebone Black](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:102399) and modified its SCAD file to make it much taller. You can download this modified SCAD file and associated files [here][1].
