The instrument is finished! After a few months of hard work, I am happy to say the sonAqua has turned out well and is pretty fun to play. Here's a video of my performance:

Looking back on the instrument's development, there are several things that could have been improved:

Primarily, the use of the water level sensor added unnecessary stress and cost to the project. Initially, I thought the water level sensor would be perfect for my idea. After purchasing the $40 sensor, I realized that it must remain perfectly straight in order to provide consistent data. In a horizontal tube of water, this proved to be an issue because the 8-inch sensor sags downward. In order to compensate for this issue, I glued the sensor to a metal brace and firmly secured it to the cap so it wouldn’t budge. Even with the brace, the moving water in the tube causes the unsupported part of the sensor to bend, which can result in spikes in data which can be unpredictable. It still sounds interesting, but is difficult to control. In another iteration of this instrument, I believe similar results could be found using accelerometer or similar sensors.

Another major issue with the instrument is waterproofing. Water and electronics don’t mix incredibly well, so I devoted a significant amount of effort into ensuring that water would not leak from the main chamber into the cap housing the electronics. After 8 different attempts at sealing the tube with hot glue, tape, silicone aquarium sealant, and plumber’s silicone sealing wrap, the instrument still leaks. I believe the issue comes from between the 3d-printed buffers and the PVC cap, but since the outside of the instrument is permanently sealed there is no way to remedy this situation. This problem arises from mislabeled PVC caps on Amazon, marketed as 3 inches in diameter when in reality they were 3.25 inches. In the future, I would find better caps with threads in order to screw the cap on and create a watertight seal rather than trying to create a seal using bonding materials. 

Another big issue is draining the tube. I designed and implemented a valve system which used a short hose and a valve to allow water to drain around the electronics and back into the tube. Unfortunately, the way the drain is implemented doesn’t allow air flow and results in what can generously be called a trickle. Draining and filling the sonAqua takes several minutes and spills everywhere which is incredibly annoying and I would definitely like to improve this aspect in future builds. This could possibly be remedied by adding an air flow hole.
