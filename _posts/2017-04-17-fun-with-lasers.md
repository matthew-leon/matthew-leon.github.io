Now onto the enclosure. I need a place to store the Bela and a breadboard. I like the idea of a clear box so the audience can see the inner wiring of the instrument and can see the flashing lights of the Bela. After attempting to 3D print a housing, I decided to laser cut acrylic instead. Using [Makercase](http://www.makercase.com/) and Adobe Illustrator I was able to design a worthy housing for the Bela. It features holes for FSR's, buttons, 1/8" audio out, a grill for a speaker, and the right sized hole for resting the tube. You can check out the illustrator files [here][1]. Below you'll see a video of the laser cutter in action:
